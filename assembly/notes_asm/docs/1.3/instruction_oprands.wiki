= instruction operands =

instructions can have different types of operands. Each instruction itself 
will have a fixed number of operands (0-3)

== register ==
these refer to CPU registers

== memory ==
data in memory. The address of the data can either be hardcoded into the 
instructio or be stored in the instruction itself (in the code segment)

== immediate ==
fixed values in instruction itself. They're stored in the code segment.

== implied ==
these arne't explicitly shown - increment adds one to a register or memory.
