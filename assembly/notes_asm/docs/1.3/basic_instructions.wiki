= basic instructions =

== mov ==
mov moves data from one location to another;
                        mov dest, src
the data in src is copied to dest. the two operands _MUST_ be the same size

example:

mov     eax, 3  ; store 3 into the register EAX
mov     bx, ax  ; store the value of ax into the bx register

== add ==
add is used to add integers

add     eax, 4 ; eax = eax + 4
add     al, ah ; al = al + ah

== sub ==
sub subtracts two integers the same way add does

sub     eax, 4 ; eax = eax - 4

== inc / dec ==
inc increments the value by 1. dec decrements by 1.
since this is implicit, you can pss in either an integer or an address

inc     ecx ;ecs++
dec     dl ; dl--
